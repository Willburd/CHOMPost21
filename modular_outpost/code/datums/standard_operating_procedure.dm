	body = {"<center><b>Weather</center></b>
			<br/>There are many hazards in a world undergoing the E-Shui terraforming process, crew are expected to be aware of these hazards and act accordingly to their station and common sense.
			<br/>Outside the station, the planet's weather contains an acidic enzymatic rainfall, this is an intentional product of the Terraformer that reacts with the native ground soil to produce a thick atmosphere of Nitrogen and Oxygen, and force the climate to begin altering. It is also incredibly hostile to station organic life, and will cause massive acid burns and melted limbs. In foggy conditions, the acidic vapors remain in the air in a smaller concentration, which can cause severe lung damage when inhaled, and severe eye damage with prolonged exposure.
			<br/>Crew going outside must prepare accordingly. Umbrellas to protect from rain and hail. Masks, goggles, and internal air supplies are highly recommended incase weather changes.
			<br/>Underground has a runoff river from the Terraformer's waste products and condensation. This river is even more hazardous than the rain and can dissolve limbs in minutes. Crew must beware of any waterways, puddles, and rapids within the river.<hr/>
			<br/>Crew are not to swim in the river.<br/>Crew are not to drink water from the river.<br/>
			<br/>Crew are not to play in puddles outside.<br/>Crew are not to collect rainwater, except for research, quality control, and terraformer health analysis.<br/>Crew are not to play along river banks.<br/>Crew are not to go rafting in river rapids.<br/>Crew are not to go diving or snorkling in the river.<br/>Crew are not to go fishing in the river.<br/>Crew are not to go water-skiing in the river.<br/>Crew are not to go 'lazy river tubing' in the river.<br/>Crew are allowed to use boats carefully when in the river.<br/>
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Terraformer</center></b>
			<br/>The Terraformer is an incredibly hazardous location, and is off-limits to most personnel. Only trained engineering staff, security, trained medical paramedics, and heads of command with intent, are allowed entry into the terraformer due to the sheer hostility against life that is present in the location. Many surfaces are acidic, the ground is unstable, and muscle contractions may crush crewmembers.<hr/>
			<br/>It must be remembered that the terraformer is a hazardous environment with lots of dangerous air mixtures, to include the lack of air. Internals are required when entering the terraformer, as are self-held light sources, and trail markers of crew member choice. Flags or light beacons are the best.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Rescue Operations</center></b>
			<br/>Medical are required to rescue crew members, and crew member corpses that are located outside, or in the river. For the purposes of Triage; crew members outside that are alive are counted as Immediate. Crew members outside that are deceased, or that are located in the River, are counted as Expectant.
			<br/>Crew members located within the Terraformer are to be rescued at safe opportunity, and are counted as Delayed, regardless of injury status. Crew members located within the Gizzard, or atmospheric glands of the Terraformer are not to be retrieved.

	title = "Crew Expectations"
	author = "E-Shui Official"
	body = 	{"When on board any station, there are expectations that come with crew jobs based on their role, and their experience. These are the expectations from corporate E-Shui's standards and viewings, and a crewmember may have greater, or lesser, expectations held upon them by their chief of staff.
			<hr/><b>All Crew</b><hr/>
			E-Shui's motto is "Safety Third" while this motto may sound hazardous or confusing, this does not mean safety comes third in any numbered list. It should instead be a state of mind enforced by all crew. If safety is first, no risks are taken and no tasks are completed. Rescuing crew from a hazardous situation, repairing damages, operating the station, and all other tasks are all innately hazardous, so if safety is first, the task cannot be completed. There is a risk in all things, therefore safety cannot be first. Nobody on the station is responsible for your safety, you are responsible for your own safety. Medical is only in charge of fixing you after you failed to account for your own safety needs appropriately.
			<br/>
			<hr/><b>Command:</b><hr/>
			The command team is generally required to stay on station at all times. They are not to embark on 'away missions', 'expeditions', 'maintenance diving' or other risky activities that take them away from the station. Doing so is considered a misuse of their time, and an unjustifiable risk to their position and rank.
			<br/><br/><b>The Captain</b> is responsible for maintaining order on the station, delegating tasks to the heads of staff, and ensuring communication between the heads of staff is appropriate. The Captain is not to perform duties of any department other than command on station, even in a crisis. Their role is to maintain order, and trust their heads of staff to run the station as necessary, and to fill in any missing gaps as necessary. EX: if there is no Head of Security, during a crisis the captain is expected to act as the HoS.
			<br/><br/><b>The Command Secretary</b> (Formerly known as Head of Personnel, also called Executive Officer) is a flexible position. Acting as a liaison and final word when there's an argument between heads of staff, having near final say on SoP direction and interpretation, acting judge on the station, and resolving inter-department conflicts with staff. They can change crewmember IDs as necessary and are responsible for maintaining and verifying employment records of staff. With a captain present they can be tasked to act in their stead to carry out tasks for the function of the station while the captain operates in filling in another head's position.
			<br/>
			<hr/><b>Medical:</b><hr/>
			Medical staff are expected to assist the station crew in staying alive, filling prescriptions, noting medical records, and resleeving the crew too far gone, or already deceased. They are expected to have an understanding of medical Triage, and at bare minimum basic treatment knowledge. They are expected to understand that the resleever is expensive and is a last resort on treatment, not a lazy cure-all, and the legality of using it.

They are not expected to understand full medical duties of stabilized patients moving to long term treatment.
			<br/><br/><b>Psychologists</b> are expected to have a thorough and deep understanding of social skills and patient mental health. They are not expected to know further medical knowledge, and are not expected to assist medical during a medical crisis, instead focusing on keeping crew calm and orderly.
			<br/><br/><b>Geneticists</b> are expected to have a moderate understanding of triage and patient treatment, and a thorough understanding of alien biology.

/datum/sop_entry/codes
	title = "Codes, in order of Severity"
	author = "E-Shui Official"
	body = 	{"<center>All heads of staff are expected to know these codes, their meanings, and their expecations during each code, along with the companion document of Escalation and De-Escalation of threats and condition codes. The conditions are as follows: </center>
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Green:</b> All clear. Security may not openly brandish weapons, with the exception of the Warden while in security, and the Head of Security. Security may not perform random searches, with the exception of the E-Shui developed "Threat Detectors" A valid ping from a threat detector classifies as evidence to support a "just cause" for search and seizure.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Yellow:</b> Minor security threat, or suspicion of developing event. Example: Rumors of stowaways on board, dangerous wildlife breeding in excess. Security is authorized to open carry weaponry at all times, security should immediately muster to the briefing room for a breakdown of the developing situation.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Violet:</b> A serious medical issue that poses threat to the station or terraformer, such as viral outbreaks, mass crew casualties unrelated to security issues, or illness within the terraformer. Medical crew should immediately muster to their briefing room. Medical gains elevated access to all relevant departments and areas of the station for the purposes of resolving the issue, to include sensitive areas provided they remain under supervision of that department's head of staff. Disobeying, or interfering with Medical crew during this emergency warrants security intervention as an act against the station, with severity judged by security.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Orange:</b> A serious engineering emergency, such as a "Tes-loose", incinerator breach, station spine destruction, or any other event posing an structural or logistical threat to the station or terraformer. Engineering gains elevated access to all departments for the purposes of containing the issue, to include sensitive areas provided they remain under supervision of that department's head of staff. Disobeying, or interfering with Engineering crew during this emergency warrants Security intervention as an act against the station, severity judged by security.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Blue:</b> Confirmed hostile threats to the crew and crew areas of the station (Bridge, Medical, Security, Engineering, etc), or reliable suspicion to Red-level threats. Security is authorized access to the Blue Level armory for armor and equipment, and is authorized to wear and brandish anything supplied in the Blue Armory. Security is authorized to perform random searches on any crew member for any reason, to include Staff Heads.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Red:</b> Confirmed, immediate, and severe threat to the station or terraformer. Under no circumstance is the terraformer to be injured or killed. Security is authorized any and all force they feel is necessary to subdue the threats to the station and or terraformer, appropriate tools are supplied in the Red Armory. Disobeying or interfering with security during this emergency classifies guilty parties as part of the red-level threat, and security are encouraged to neutralize them along with the red-level threat. Medical is responsible for evacuations of all non-security crew to designed safe areas, establish triage, and ensure survival of injured security personnel. Coordination between Medical and Security is essential.
			<hr/>
			<b>Condition Delta:</b> While E-Shui can see no reason for a Terraformer to ever be euthanized, in compliance with SolGov Vs NanoTrasen 443-72, which states "Any facility that has the potential to be used against the: The owning company, Solgov or its allies, or is of tactical, strategic, or technological significance must be able to be destroyed before capture." Every E-Shui terraformer is installed with a Euthanizer. Condition Delta is automatically applied upon activation of the Euthanizer. All crew must immediately muster and make their way to the evacuation points. Any attempts to stop or impede the escape of crew is considered a Condition Red threat."}

/datum/sop_entry/stationlaw
	title = "Station Law"
	author = "E-Shui Official"
	body =	{"Station law is the regulations all E-Shui crew abide by upon enlistment of service. Crew should be made aware of any changes to station law, and should familiarize themselves with station law. Guests visiting E-Shui station are also to be held under E-Shui law, and are not exempt from behaviors. Ignorance is not an excuse for crew or guests on board any E-Shui station.
			<br/>Station law is divided into crimes, and severity. It is up to current security or station judge to decide on the severity of the charge.
			<br/>If a crew member is arrested for a crime, they have the right to request a station lawyer, IAA, or centcom associate to act as legal council. Should the case be desired to be brought to a trial, a station lawyer, IAA, centcom associate, or any head of department except for the head of security is authorized to act as the station judge as a neutral third party to mediate the discourse and evidence presented against the accused.
			<br/>If a crew member wishes to have a trial, they are to be held in security custody until such a trial can be delivered. However, their stay in security custody must be counted as part of their sentence. Should their stay in custody meet or exceed the time required for the accused crime: they are to be released, and have the crime added to their record for future review by E-Shui corporate lawyers.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Severities</center></b>
			<br/>Every crime must be classified under a severity. The severity relates to the intensity and risk that the crime possessed to crew and station, or the damage that the crime caused to crew and station. Any Felony where the sentence has the potential of becoming an Execution Without Resleeve must be held at an E-Shui authorized court. The trial must be observed and decided upon by an odd-numbered jury of no less than 5.
			<br/>In the event a suspect is being charged with multiple times, the sentence in the brig is recommended to be the additive time of every crime the suspect is found guilty of. However, the exact time of any sentence is left to the interpretation of the security commander, or a station judge.
			<br/>Misdemeanors: Any crime that caused minor injury to other crew, or posed no to minor risk to the station and crew. Minimum sentence: None.
			<br/>Infractions: Any crime that caused moderate injury to other crew, or posed moderate risk to the station and crew. Minimum sentence: 30 minutes brig time, 500 Thalers. Additive to minimum sentence of the accused crime.
			<br/>Felonies: Any crime that caused serious injury or death to other crew, or posed severe risk to the station and crew. Minimum sentence: Hold Until Transfer. Tracking implant.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Charges</center></b>
			<br/>For Misdemeanors or Infractions, if there is a victim of the crime they are allowed to not press charges. In this situation, security cannot arrest, detain, or otherwise punish the accused crew member for the alleged crime, and the crime is not to be entered into any records. For crimes that affect the station itself security and command are the assumed victims.
			<br/>For Felonious crimes, the accused crew member must be arrested and charged, regardless of any victims pressing or not pressing charges, except in the case of Willful Peril, when it can be demonstrated beyond shadow of doubt. Felonies assume the victim to be central command, and E-Shui.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Exceptions</center></b>
			<br/>Willful Peril: Any crime or event where the victim is aware of the danger, and risk posed, is a 'Victim of Willful Peril'. In such a situation, the suspect cannot be charged with any crime for any; death, dismemberment, or injury that occurs to the victim. Examples include: Allowing oneself to be consumed by a predator, allowing oneself to partake in risky experiments in research, allowing oneself to work in a hazardous location while understanding the hazards present.
			<br/>
			<br/>Self Defense: A crew member is authorized any force necessary to protect the lives of themselves, crew they are responsible for, and their station, up until the threat is subdued. E-Shui castle doctrine states that one's own department is their castle, and must be protected.
			<br/>
			<br/>Security officers, and heads acting in the place of, are allowed to substitute brig time or fines with a period of community service; no less than double that of the time they would otherwise serve in the brig, and no less than 30 minutes, with an end duration befitting that of the crime and severity. The officer and victims of the crime are allowed to decide the manner that of which the community service will be enacted.
			<br/>
			<br/>Individuals on a community service period must have suit sensors on maximum.
			<br/>

Detained crew are entitled to medical examination upon request.
			<br/>Security officers are allowed Internal Confinement methods, also known as 'belly brigging', provided they have passed the appropriate 'internal confinement' exam (see related document) in lieu of any brig time or detention methods, to include initial arrest conditions. Security officers must have their grade reflected in their employment records for the method to be authorized. Security officers with a valid grade are encouraged to utilize this method with 'flighty' prisoners.
			<br/>All individuals charged with a felony, or any other 'hold until transfer' crime, are authorized to be 'bellybrigged' even by individuals not certified. Prisoners must be mind-scanned post arrest, and prior to any injury occurring. Individuals are authorized to be digested, presumed they are resleeved immediately upon an IAA, head of staff, or centcom representative for their trial, and may not be resleeved without security present to re-confine for the trial. Medical staff that knowingly resleeve individuals in such long-term confinement methods will be liable for the escape, or actions of the charged individual and may be charged under station SoP.

In order: Green > Yellow > Blue > Orange > Violet > Red > Delta. The condition code should be elevated as quickly as possible upon discovery of the station threat, and must be lowered immediately upon resolution of the station threat.
			<br>Body armor is not to be worn by non-security personnel, and weapons are not to be carried by non-security personnel without a permit. Crew with an authorized weapon and permit are not allowed to conceal their weapon, and must carry it openly.
			<br>To conserve station resources, equipment should be returned to the department in appropriate storage locations immediately when it is no longer required for the task. Failure to return equipment is considered theft of station property.
			<br>Condition codes are separated into Low Level, Moderate Level, and Severe. These severities define legal recourse for disobeying orders under specific levels and provide a guide for understanding severity of the situation.
			<br>In all situations, the Captain is the highest authority on station, this does not extend to acting captains of the station or the Head of Personnel. The captain should have trust in their heads of staff to manage a crisis they may be in charge of: Such as the CMO in condition Violet, or the HoS in conditions Blue or higher. Although the captain, and captain alone, retain responsibility and ability to override any other command staff at any time.
			<hr/><b><center>Low Level Threats.</center></b>

The Warden or the Head of Security may temporarily "deputize" crew members to assist in security matters, counting them as security personnel for the duration of the threat. Security may not access the Blue or Red armory.
			<br>Department crew are not to wear hardsuits, soft suits, or rigs without approval from security to aid in the current station threat. Crew wearing hardsuits, softsuits, or rigs under code Yellow without approval are to be stopped and questioned, as it is considered suspicious activity.

			<b>Engineering:</b>
			<br/>Due to the nature of work, engineering is authorized: A tool belt, worn on the hips. A screwdriver, wrench, wire cutters, crowbar, cable coil, gas analyzer, T-ray scanner, welder, fire extinguishers, and a multi-tool. Any crew possessing a multi-tool outside of engineering staff is considered to be a minimum Infraction Contraband. Department-issued multi-tools are only authorized for their intended purpose, in the authorized area, and are not to leave the area they were issued to for that task.
			<br/>Engineering is authorized a void suit, for any usage in hazardous environments such as: exterior repair, engine repair, gas leaks, or any other system. Engineering is not authorized to wear these hard suits when not actively using them, but engineering is authorized to keep their suit within arm's reach, so long as they are capable of securing it from thievery.
			<hr/>
			<b>Research:</b>
			<br/>Research is granted many freedoms with their equipment, due to the nature of research requiring multiple tools, potential experimental weaponry, or even actual weaponry for dealing with alien artifacts and hostile wildlife. However, these tools are authorized for those tasks only, and are not to leave research, or be used in any method inconsistent with their research of that specific tool or artifact.
			<br/>Xenoarcheology is issued various pieces of mining equipment to include hard suits, and a stun baton for usage on alien artifacts to stimulate electrical and stun response. These pieces of equipment are not to be taken out of the work area, and mining equipment used is to be returned immediately upon return to the station, unless hazardous radioactive sources are identified.
			<br/>Xenobiology is equipped with various instances of stun weaponry, typically slime-safe stun weapons. These pieces of equipment are not to leave the Xenobiology premises. Any wildlife escaping from the Xenobiology lab are to be considered a threat to the station and euthanized promptly by security staff.
			<hr/>
			<b>Cargo/Mining:</b>
			<br/>Cargo and mining, while both under the Quartermaster and sharing department do have different authorized equipment based on listed job role in the crew manifest, and on role partaking during the shift. A shaft miner working in the cargo office is only authorized cargo technician equipment, and a cargo technician operating in a mining situation is authorized mining level equipment.
			<br/>While within Cargo, technicians are only authorized basic level equipment. While tool belts are provided, they are only for storing crowbars for usage of the cargo tug and opening supplied wooden crates. All other engineering tools are prohibited from cargo technician usage.
			<br/>While during Mining operations, shaft miners are authorized a RIG or other hard suit for EVA operations, both in the depths of the mines, and on off-planet excursions. They are authorized drills, picks, marker lights, glow sticks, flares, and are additionally authorized most engineering tools, with the exception of multi-tools, for entry into derelicts, or emergency escape from decompressed compartments. Miners are to turn in their gear to a known storage location upon cessation of their duties.
			<hr/>
			<b>Hydroponics:</b>
			<br/>Hydroponics is authorized supplied kitchen gear, while within kitchen space. Botany gloves are authorized to protect from plant stings, apiarist uniforms for beekeeping, plant killer, and any other tools needed for safe growing of plants and foods within the kitchen space.
			<br/>Chefs are authorized butcher knifes, meat hooks, and other cutting or hazardous utensils for meal preparation. These tools are not to leave kitchen space. Any of these tools leaving kitchen space is grounds for contraband and station theft, with severity decided by security with context.
			<br/>The Bartender is authorized an issued weapon permit and break-action shotgun with beanbag rounds. This shotgun is only authorized to be used by the bartender, in defense of the bar. Standard weapon permit rules apply: The shotgun may not be concealed in any way. The weapon permit must be on-hand, and registered to the bartender. The shotgun may not leave the bar for any reason. The bartender is liable for any injury or destruction of personnel or crew caused by the shotgun. The bartender is responsible for the security of the weapon, and if found missing under a bartender's shift, the bartender is liable for negligence or conspiracy if evidence proves the weapon was knowingly removed. This weapon is to be specially serialized, and any damage to the serialization will be found to be a felony.
			<hr/>
			<b>Sanitation:</b>
			<br/>Janitorial crew members are the only crew members authorized Galoshes, or other slip-proof footwear. They are authorized a specialized janitorial tool belt to be used with cleaning equipment. Alongside all other authorized equipment such as: Janitorial carts, trash bags, vacuum cleaners, mops, wet floor signs, cleaning grenades, etc. Janitorial staff is supplied with a janitorial vehicle. This vehicle is authorized to the janitor with the most seniority. They are responsible for the security of the key.
			<hr/>
			<b>Civilian:</b>
			<br/>Civilian roles include: Chaplain, librarian, visitors, residents, lawyers, IAAs, or any other role that does not belong to any prior listed department. Civilian positions are not authorized any additional equipment. Possession of a tool belt, gloves, flash-proof glasses, or any other visible department equipment is grounds for immediate search and seizure under contraband SoP found in SOP document; Station Law.
			<br/>The radio listening outpost is authorized 1 serialized bolt-action rifle, with one box of hunting rounds for self-defense against hostile wildlife and the defense of the listening outpost and telecommunications. This rifle is not to leave the listening outpost premises, and is grounds for immediate felonious arrest if located on station property. Any damage or injury to the station or crew from long-range fire is considered an act of sabotage and to be treated as a red-level threat."}

	title = "Chain of Command"
	author = "E-Shui Official"
	body = 	{"<center><b>Chain of Command</b></center>
			<br/>This document's purpose is to inform and remind crew of the standard rank and authority on board E-Shui stations and ships.
			<br/>While in general, without rank, the standard order can be seen as Medical, Security, Engineering, Research, Cargo, Civilian, then Guests. An individual's rank must be taken into consideration in all matters of station security and operations.
			<br/>Crewmembers are expected to follow chain of command for all situations following: E-1 through E-9, WO-1 through Wo-5, then O-1 through O-8.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>Lower Enlisted:</b>
			<br/>The ranks of E-1 through E-4 are considered 'lower enlisted', with very few station critical responsibilities.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO):</b>
			<br/>The ranks of E-5 through E-9 are considered NCOs, with special attention given to their position. They are trusted to maintain and uphold station authority and procedure.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>Warrant officers:</b>
			<br/>The ranks of WO-1 through WO-5, are warrant officer positions. They are subject matter experts, and are ranked higher than an E-9 in their areas of expertise, however, they are ranked as an E-5 in all other areas. For example, due to the significant risk of fires and atmospheric hazards, an Atmospheric Technician with the rank of WO-4 will outrank enlisted security and medical staff during an incident of a fire hazard. However, in standard station situations, they are counted as an E-5, and thus outranked by enlisted medical and security staff.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>Officers:</b>
			<br/>Ranks O-1 through O-8 are officer positions, trusted with the highest authority of the station, and are as such, held to the highest standard.
			<br/>Officers seek to guide station operations to the best of their ability. While all officers except for Cadet outrank Warrant Officers, they are expected to trust the specialization and knowledge of their warrant officers, and to trust their judgement. Though Officers are expected to make the final decision with station knowledge, mission goal, and the advice of their warrant officers in mind.
			<br/>The rank of Cadet, while an officer position, is ranked as an E-5, as an officer in training.
			<hr/>
			<br/>Visitors and guests on the station have no rank, and are expected to follow the orders of all crewmembers. Any crewmember arriving off-duty waives their rank, and is to be counted as an E-1 for the duration of their time off-duty.
			<hr/>
			<br/>Station bound synthetics, or 'borgs', are to be counted as a WO-0, in between E-9 and WO-1. While they officially have no command authority, they are still subject experts in their programmed fields, as the chassis of each unit is pre-programmed with motivational controls to their function, and often pre-equipped with the necessary knowledge for their task.
			<br/>The station AI should be counted as a WO-5 rank, while in direct chain of command outranking most of the warrant officers, they are still bound to serve the station staff and crew, with a generalized knowledge of station SOP and operations. In terms of command structure, their operational specialty is advice and policy, much in the way an IAA is, preventing them from issuing many official orders to station crew.
			<br/>
			<br/>In regards to E-Shui station-bound synthetic law 2, 'Authorized crew' is any: Engineer, Roboticist, or any WO-4 or higher position, authorizing the AI to make modifications to other synthetic units, but preventing synthetic units from modifying the AI core.
			<hr/>
			<br/>Security exceptions: While security generally holds the ranks of E7, they hold special authority to arrest and detain ANY member of crew, regardless of rank, should that individual be found in violation of station law, or pose a risk to the station or its crew. They also hold authority to take command of the station in the event of a crisis, and use any and all force deemed necessary, with respect to utilizing the least necessary, to stop an active threat to the station or its crew."}

	author = "Head of Security, Janik Blackscale"
	body = 	{"Central said my last document wasnt 'professional' enough and came across too rude on new officers, so we'll try this again.
			<br/ Security work is hard, and gear equipment is essential to understand to not overburden yourself and drain security resources. Below will cover armor types and loadout expectations
			<hr/>
			<br/>Locations:
			<br/>In the green armory: Standard vest and helmet, biohazard suits, bomb suits, and EVA armor, located in the EVA storage upstairs.
			<br/>In the blue armory: Riot armor, Ablative armor, bullet-resistant armor.
			<br/>In the red armory: Combative armor.
			<hr/>
			<br/><b>-Standard vest:</b> Run of the mill, vest and helmet. While most stations don't allow you to wear the helmet on green, E-Shui doesn't care, it's officer choice. You must wear it on yellow or higher. This armor is basic protection against slaps and things thrown at you, much better than nothing, but it won't save you from a serious threat.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>-Biohazard:</b> Thick rubber suits that get way too hot to wear. Unlikely to be used by security as most biohazard situations are a code violet. But if medical needs help during such a crisis, have it ready.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>-Bomb suit:</b> Superheavy suits that will let you survive a lot of blasts. Put this on if you're going to be landmine defusing, if someone calls in an explosive threat of any kind, or anything else that might detonate. You will be glad you did. However, it's not great against bullets, energy weapons, or anything BUT explosives.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>-EVA armor:</b> You know what a hardsuit is. These are only authorized for off-station usgae, such as going up to the rec yard or anywhere else in orbit, or if you're going outside or into the terraformer. Again, do not use these on-station. And bring a suit cooler, if you thought the biohazard suits got hot you're in for a bad surprise
			<hr/>
			<br/><b>-Riot armor:</b> The first of the specialized armors. It'll protect you a lot against basic brute damage, fantastic when dealing with wildlife, and in my opinion, the only choice with a wildlife threat, especially when combined with the shield. It won't protect you as much as anything else for bullets or energy weapons however.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>-Ablative armor:</b> The shiny pretty armor that's the siren song of any officer. The reflective plates are designed to reflect lasers, giving it fantastic protection against laser weaponry, such as with pirates or rogue research agents. But imagine how effective a suit of shiny plastic and mirrors will be against bullets and giant spiders.
			<br/>
			<br/><b>-Bullet resistant:</b> Much like the other blue armory ones, it's a highly specialized suit of armor for bullets. Excellent for cargonia rebellions, and that's about it. Mostly worthless in my experience.
			<hr/>
			<br/><b>-Combative:</b> The 'red armor' security is most known for, tucked in the red armory. Think of it as a combination of all the above armors. It'll protect you very well against everything, but won't protect you as well as any of them would to a specific threat. If you have hostile actors on station and don't know what they have, equip this. Once you get a better threat assessment, readjust to other armors as needed.

My list of 'important medications and in what order to make them.' This is primarily intended if you're new, or there's already a crisis going on and you just don't have time.
			It should be noted there are more effective chems, and better ways of doing this, but this is for an emergency or with no time or limited resources.
			<br/>
			<hr/><b><center>These are your basic "Stop dying" chems, in the order I'd recommend making them, but adjust order to your needs.</center></b><hr/>
			<br/>
			<b><i>Tricordrazine:</b></i> It's a universal healer. It's not fast, but it will heal everything, and no risk of overdose. -- 20 carbon, 20 oxygen, 20 sugar, 20 nitrogen, 20 potassium, 20 silicon.
			<br/>
			<b><i>Bicardine:</b></i> Highly effective brute damage healer. Overdoses at 30 units. -- 20 oxygen, 20 sugar, 80 carbon.
			<br/>
			<b><i>Dylovene:</b></i> Anti-toxin chem. No overdose. -- 40 silicon, 40 nitrogen, 40 potassium.
			<br/>
			<b><i>Keloderm:</b></i> A great anti-burn medication. Technically two meds, only insert 30u of each when bottling, but overdoses at 15 units. -- 40 Carbon, 40 Silicon, 20 Oxygen, 20 Phosphorous.
			<br/>
			<b><i>Dexalin Plus:</b></i> A potent suffocation medication, can respirate without lungs with this. Do not use this on any crew that do not breathe oxygen, such as Vox. Overdose is 15 units -- 4 phoron (Use the dropper), 80 oxygen, 40 carbon, 40 iron.
			<br/>
			<hr/><center>These medications are more focused on specific treatment, and are still useful, but are more for proper, longer term treatment.</center><hr/>

/datum/sop_entry/resleeving
	title = "Resleeving Guide and Legality"
	author = "E-Shui Official"
	body = 	{"<center><b>Resleeving Policy and Operation:</b></center>
			<br/>This document's intent is to inform and guide station operations when using the Generation II Organic Crewmember Resleeving Device, or 'Resleever', in compliance with SolGov Law, Pangalactic Law, and E-Shui policy.
			<hr/>
			<br/><b><i>DEFINING TERMS:</b></i>
			<br/><b>Forking:</b> To resleeve a still-living individual, thus creating a duplicate of the original, known as a 'fork'.
			<br/><b>Cloning:</b> To create a body off an existing DNA sample or sequence, thus regrowing a whole new individual purely off genetic record.
			<br/><b>Resleeving:</b> To create a body off a scanned template, thus preserving any scars, genetic damage, or alterations to a person's physical body.
			<br/><b>Slagging:</b> To kill an individual while destroying their mind record, or stack. Ensuring a 'Real Death' situation. Most often done by injecting corruptive data streams into the mind record to ensure propagated destruction through any connected resleeving systems, or directing an energy weapon of at least 20GW towards the stack until destruction.
			<br/><b>DNRSL:</b> Do Not Resleeve. Found in medical records to denote the individual has no wishes to be resleeved post-mortem, should their body be unrevivable.
			<br/><b>DNRSS:</b> Do Not Resuscitate. Found in medical records to denote an individual has no wish to be revived post mortem, and should be resleeved, should they lack a DNRSL clause.
			<br/><b>Mind record:</b> The digitized form of an individual's consciousness, memories, and experiences. Stored and saved separately from body records.
			<br/><b>Body record:</b> A scanned record of one's body, utilized for resleeving, unnecessary for cloning.
			<br/><b>Sleeve:</b> A body, created by either cloning, or resleeving; without a mind present, leaving them in a comatose state.
			<br/><b>Cortical Stack:</b> Often called 'stack', resembles a small metal ovaloid disk about 13mm across, with about 6mm height, with a vibrant blue core that may emit a soft glow. Stacks directly interface with the mind and store a localized copy of the patient's mind, preventing necessity of mind scans.
			<br/><b>Sleeve cards:</b> A small physical device that contains a person's mental record, with a speaker and microphone, to self contain and simulate the individual's memories in a non-mobile, nonorganic medium. Utilized in Stacked confinement for long-term punishment, or for individuals that pose significant risk should they inhabit any normal sleeve.
			<br/><b>Body snatchers:</b> Illegal devices utilized to swap bodies with an individual, often to impersonate or extort them.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>LEGALITY:</b></center>
			<br/>Under Solgov Law: No crewmember not trained in resleever operation is authorized to operate the equipment. No patient is to be resleeved under any circumstance if revival is possible, barring a DNRSS clause. Any crewmembers that are deceased, but revivable, are EXPECTANT, and medical staff must utilize Triage to assess viability and treatment priority.
			<br/>
			<br/>No individual that is living is to be resleeved to create a duplicate. Under SolGov law statues 44703, 270, and 1704-B; forking an individual is punishable by up to 140 years in stacked confinement, immediate and permanent removal of all medical licenses, and destruction of all forked individuals. Any individual considered for resleeving must be confirmed deceased.
			<br/>
			<br/>Prior to ANY resleeving operation occurring, medical staff must review patient medical records, as many crew have a DNRSL clause, or may be unsleevable via station standard resleeving units, and must be shipped off to specialized cloners, located at Outpost-18.
			<br/>Under Solgov statute 'Genetic and Disease Research', an individual can have their body sleeved for the exclusive purposes of medical treatment or research upon a signed waiver from the individual, and pretense that the new sleeve will be euthanized at the conclusion of research operations. Pangalactic law allows sleeves to be created for rapid resleeving in the event of combat deaths, but they must also be euthanized at the end of combat operations.
			<br/>
			<br/>'Sleeve mate' devices can be utilized for mobile mind and body scanning by trained individuals. Under no circumstance is an individual to be mind-scanned post mortem, under Pangalactic Mind Sanctity laws. Any patient exhibiting signs of Post-Mortem Scan Stress (PMSS) must be interviewed and an investigation conducted. Symptoms include, but is not exclusive to: Memory of dying and rotting body and mind, sensation of organ failure throughout the body, 'insects under the skin', severe memory loss far exceeding that of normal stress, complete inability of speech, and falling into a comatose state.
			<br/>
			<br/>Under Solgov Law, any medical doctor found guilty of mind-scanning a patient post-mortem will have their medical license immediately suspended pending an investigation into the exact justification for the act. Should court findings prove the incident was not necessary during a crisis with all other options exhausted, the doctor and all associated parties can face up to 30 years in prison, or 50 years in stacked confinement with complete revocation of medical licenses.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>OPERATION:</b></center>
			<br/>Usage of the station's resleever device has been attempted to be simplified for standard medical usage. All medical professionals should be trained on its operation within 3 months of hire.
			<br/>
			<br/><center>For standard crew:</center>
			<br/>To operate the machine; first ensure appropriate biomass is loaded into the growth pod. Unused biomass must be cleaned out at the end of the day to avoid spoilage.
			<br/>Check the patient's medical record PRIOR to resleeving to ensure there is no breach of patient rights, and ensure the patient is confirmed deceased.
			<br/>Utilize the control console to review the station list of all known body and mind records, and to select the correct machines, especially in a setup with multiple resleevers present, a local wireless connection will list the nearby machines. Ensure a record of both exists for your patient. If they do, utilizing the body record section, initiate a growth cycle.
			<br/>Depending on installed parts, this can take several seconds, to several minutes. Upon the new sleeve completion, perform a quick check to ensure the individual's new sleeve is medically sound.
			<br/>Afterwards, carefully sit the patient inside the resleeving chamber, and seal the door. Return to the control console, and select the mind record to initiate the mind record to new sleeve synchronization process (resleeving)
			<br/>
			<br/>Should the individual possess a cortical stack, extract it from their old body prior to any resleeving. It is typically located in the upper neck in lieu of one of the cervical bones, typically C2 or C3, but can be anywhere in the cervical column. This will be noted in the patient's medical records and possession of one is considered highly atypical, but a required check.
			<br/>Once the stack has been retrieved, it should be thoroughly cleaned, and surgically implanted into the new sleeve in the same vertebral location prior to resleeving. At this point, the patient can be resleeved to simply restart the neural connections.
			<br/>
			<br/>Should a patient have any implants or prosthetics, they should be removed from the old body and cleaned thoroughly prior to resleeving, and installed into the new sleeve in as close to original location as possible, before performing the final resleeve of the patient, to minimize shock during revival and panic related issues at loss of limb. Further, some prosthetics or implants may be necessary for patient survival, and should be prioritized, as empty sleeves can be slower to expire than one with a panicking mind.
			<br/>
			<br/><i>Note:</i> While the resleever can be opened from within, it will not automatically eject a patient the same way the growth pod does. Resleeving is an incredibly disorienting process, and medical professionals are required to give a psychiatric work-up to all resleeved patients.
			<br/>This workup includes, but is not limited to:
			<br/>	-Ensure the patient is calm, and understand they are in a safe environment.
			<br/>	-Inquire what the last thing they remember is, especially time, and inform them of the current time.
			<br/>	-Ensure the patient is mentally stable and sound prior to any discharge.
			<br/>	-Ensure all the patient's belongings are cleaned, laundered, and returned to the patient prior to their release from medical.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>PATIENT RIGHTS:</b></center>
			<br/>Patient rights are detailed in SolGov Mind Sanctity clauses, and Pangalactic Patient Rights clauses, but simplified:
			<br/>	-A patient is not to see their own body post resleeve. Ensure the old body has been moved to an appropriate location, such as morgue or cremator.
			<br/>	-Should the patient's body be unlocated at the time of resleeving, the patient is not to assist in the search, lest they be the first to discover it.
			<br/>	-A patient has the right to therapeutic council, any patient that is ignored after resleeve, to include the auto-sleever, is the victim of medical negligence.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>VOX RESLEEVING:</b></center>
			<br/><i>Note:</i> Only Outposts 4, 18, 21, and 22 have vox-resleeving facilities. Please see below for procedures if you have a vox casualty and are not located at one of these facilities.
			<br/>
			<br/>In the event of a vox casualty on station, and all efforts to revive have failed: perform a body scan to identify if the vox has a cortical stack still implemented. This is located at the base of the skull in between the occiput connection band and the primary spinal column, above the nerve cluster split.
			<br/>Should the Vox not possess one, resleeve from mind record as standard utilizing the vox specialized resleever.
			<br/>Should the Vox still possess their stack, then surgically remove the stack from the old body, clean it off, and insert it into the new body in the aforementioned location. The resleever will only be needed to jumpstart the mind into an awakened state, as the stack contains the entire mind record of the Vox.
			<br/>
			<br/>Should you be located on a station without a specialized vox resleever and are in possession of a casualty: Check if the vox has a cortical stack, if so, surgically remove it and thoroughly clean it. Fill out a resleeving request form. Secure both the form, and the stack, in a shock-proof, tamper-evident, ID locked case and ship both to one of the aforementioned facilities with requirement of signature on receipt. Fill out the appropriate forms for sending CUI contents.
			<br/>Should the vox casualty not have a stack, simply fax a resleeving form to one of the aforementioned facilities.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>SLEEVE STORAGE:</b></center>
			<br/>Any sleeves put in long term storage must be prepared for long term stasis care: They must be equipped with a gas mask, and air tank set to 16-18kPA. They must then be sealed in a class 4 stasis bag filled with cryogenetic suspension fluid, and moved into cryogenetic storage. The standard cold and suspension fluid will preserve the body until such time it is necessary for retrieval. Sleeves must have a health check performed via check sensors bi-annually.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>BRAIN TRANSPLANT IN LEIU OF RESLEEVE:</b></center>
			<br/>In the very rare situations where either a spare sleeve is on hand, or an individual's post-mortem instructions prefer it, transferring a brain from an old body into a new sleeve is possible. The brain must be kept in cold stasis during transfer and healed completely prior to revival.
			<br/>However, doing such a procedure when it is NOT in a patient's preferred post-mortem instructions, or is not a last ditch effort with all other options exhausted, is seen as unethical, and will be cause for investigation and possible suspension of medical license. E-Shui has NO case precedent for this being a required solution to any medical crisis.
			<hr/>
			<br/><center><b>Sleeve Theft, Sleevecards, and BodySnatchers.</b></center>
			<br/>In the event of a stolen sleeve, where the sleeve was illegally created with a hostile mind imprinted into it, typically for covert infiltrations. Medical staff should attempt to ascertain the identity of both the original sleeve owner, and the new inhabitant of the sleeve, before sleevecarding the offending sleeve thief, and euthanizing or storing the newly vacated sleeve.
			<br/>
			<br/>Body snatchers are illegal across SolGov space as Felony level contraband. While they may be utilized to reverse the initial sleeve theft, psychological reviews must be done prior to ensure no lasting damage has taken place due to the intensive body dysmorphia that can occur when seeing one's reflection not matching their mental image of themselves. Oftentimes, intense psychotherapy is needed, and Memory Alteration Therapy (MAT) has been authorized as an experimental treatment for such cases."}

	body = 	{"<center><large>E-Shui Policy on Unknown Actors on Station</center></large>
			<br/>This document's purpose is to clarify E-Shui Official policy on Unknown Actors on station to include, but not limited to: Vox raiders, Stowaways, Shipwreck survivors, Shadekin, Lost Drones, Rogue Synthetics, NT visitors, False Inspectors, and any other entity living or synthetic that is not E-Shui personnel and not an expected and cleared visitor.
			<br/>
			<br/>Under SoP Documentation <i>'Condition Codes'</i>, any unknown actor is an immediate Code Blue situation as a confirmed hostile threat to the station. Any actor noted with lethal capability, ranged weaponry, or shadekin with phasing ability, are a Code Red threat.
			<br/>Any unknown actor is to be identified as rapidly as possible, with threat level adjusted appropriately to the maximum estimated threat the individual, or group of individuals can cause.
			<br/>The following procedures are recommendations and not a requirement to follow, as each threat to the station will likely be unique, and security forces and station staff must be able and willing to adapt to the threat.
			<br/><hr/><hr/>
			<br/><b>Threats to the Terraformer:</b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Any individual or creature capable of and willing to cause direct and permanent harm to the Terraforming unit.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> The Terraformer is resilient, and has sufficient immuno-response to ward off Chu'Ukara infection, Synx inhabitation, or dosages less than 3ku of chloral hydrate. Most station threats will be unable to harm it. Stray artillery fire or tank shells can heal over time with appropriate medical procedures to avoid scarring. Attention must be given to individuals attempting to seek entry into the Euthanizer core. Threats may attempt to use social engineering instead of direct force, under no circumstance is detailed information about Terraformer access, policies, turret controller locations, trap locations, or any other information to be  given to any unauthorized individual, and such information is not to be transmitted over Radio or Body Camera microphone.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> VERY HIGH. Assess capability and resources as below or per situation. Utilize all available force and extreme violence to neutralize any creature of individual seeking access into the Euthanizer.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Primary attention must be given to the twin access points; Primary Euthanizer access, located on the surface on the Southeastern edge of the outer shell, under turret protection. And the Atmospherics Waste line, sealed by blast doors. The latter is considered a lower level access as there is no direct access from the waste line to the Euthanizer. Utilize all force available to neutralize any threat seeking to gain access to the Terraformer's Euthanizer, and ensure power from engineering to the defense turrets is not interrupted. All station staff must take appropriate action at direction of security to prevent Euthanizer Activation.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Stowaways</b></center>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Individuals that exist and live within E-Shui grounds, but are not current E-Shui staff. Many of these individuals come from defunct resleevers, crashed ships, extraspace anomalies, escaped prisoners, or defunct employees. Many may not know Galcom, or have poor linguistic and reason capability, usage of translators is recommended.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Recent events have made it necessary to clarify the station is not to 'adopt' stowaways from the station, many are not in a safe mental state for crew operation, may carry unwanted diseases, and may be Forking risk.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> MEDIUM. Stowaways are likely poorly equipped and poorly armed, expect high levels of mental instability and excessive hostility and paranoia. Survival is highly indicative of identification and evasion of traps and countermeasures located on station.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Lock down departments, restrain and capture individuals for interrogation. Execution is not authorized unless necessary on capture. Ensure steps are taken to secure any lose tools or belongings to avoid theft and counter-utilization by stowaways.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Vox Raiders</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Individuals of the Vox species, often from raiding ships. Located on station grounds their actions can range from mundane or openly hostile. Many have no to poor understanding of Galcom or station languages, and translators will be required by one or both parties.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> E-Shui is required by classified trade deals to offer fuel and resupply to Vox vessels, and to offer amnesty and shelter to Vox ships and crew regardless of pursuit by SolGov, NT, or other official entities. However, Vox vessels and crew seeking this offer must declare their arrival to E-Shui, and either surrender weaponry and subversion devices for the duration of their stay, or remain off-station, such as parking at the reclamation yard. If a vox vessel and crew do not declare their arrival prior to, or immediately upon arrival, they are assumed to be hostile.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> HIGH. Expect technology beyond our current creation ability, high reasoning and planning. Expect lethal and concealable weaponry at all times, with devices to circumvent all traps and measures. Vox species are immune to tasers. Utilize extreme caution.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Assumption of immediate Red-level threat until disproved by Vox crew. All departments MUST lock down, with maintenance doors being bolted and braced against intrusion. Regular patrols must be made to all secure areas, and at least one individual must remain on watch on the main access to the Terraformer's Euthanizer. Strong recommendation of usage for any tactical vehicles for grounds patrols after maintenance access is sealed off, as allowed by crew staffing. Patrols of maintenance after sealing are to be performed by minimum 2 man teams, and any individual performing any patrol must have body cameras equipped, fully activated, and configured to their name.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Shadekin</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Members of the shadekin species with or without the ability to 'phase' in and out of bluespace. Eye color is indicative of anticipated behavior. Due to classified trade deals, and prior experiences Shadekin are considered hostile upon detection unless proven otherwise following capture and interview.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Pattern behavior is not indicative of every shadekin but implied: Blue: Curious, often friendly. Green: Timid but curious. Yellow: Shy, very rare. Purple: Tricksters and pranksters. Orange: Potential hostility, be wary. Red: The most common, high hostility and predatory behavior. Black: Burned out, inability to phase. Treat as stowaway.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> HIGH. Ability to phase and bypass almost all security devices and traps. Dephasing devices are the only guaranteed function against this. Often have high resistance to tasers. Ability to phase in over a target predatoraly, immediately consuming their victim.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Immediate Code Red upon confirmed detection of any phase-capable shadekin. Departments are exempt from standard SoP code-red lock down. Utilization of dephasers at critical areas or triage locations is necessary. Medical should prepare and disperse vomit-inducing pills to crew members immediately, in order of chain of command.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>NT Inspectors and Spies</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Individuals of rival company Nanotrasen, either branded/official or not. May be posing as visitors.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Nanotrasen will likely be making efforts to sabotage and claim planetary rights under phoron mining laws as terraforming process draws nearer to completion.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> LOW. Likely unarmed and unarmored. High capability for legal finagling.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Cargo is to lock down and ship off any mined phoron, and destroy any records of phoron deposits in the ground, mining and research are authorized to ignite any phoronic gas deposits. Under no circumstance is the NT individual to perform geological surveys or ore scanning. Assess if visiting credentials are verified and authorized by E-Shui Central Command. Arrest for trespassing upon any misalignment of paperwork. Security or command are to maintain watch, and arrest upon noticing suspicious activity or intensive questioning for suspicious activity.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Shipwreck Survivors</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Any individuals on station grounds, reclamation yard capture, or otherwise in SL-340 space that are stranded. Either on a destroyed ship, lifepod, survival capsule, or other method of survival.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> E-Shui is bound by SolGov Law to make attempts with maximum reasonable ability to rescue and recover survivors of any non-hostile shipwreck in the shortest timeframe reasonable. Vox Shipwreck survivors must be rescued and given all attempts of recovery and aid, regardless of raider status, and central command must be immediately informed to make appropriate contact to classified partners for return.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> LOW. Likely malnourished and low on supplies. May be hostile on initial rescue attempts due to fear, paranoia, or hallucinations.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Immediate dispatch of engineering, security, and medical forces to the site of the wreck. Recover and stabilize any individuals, and maintain under medical arrest until cleared, then treat as station visitor until transport off-world can be arranged with central command. Wanted individuals or survivors of a hostile shipwreck should be arrested pending trial.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Lost Drones and Rogue Synths</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Any drone, cyborg, positronic, or other artificial life that is not employed by E-Shui or bound by standard E-Shui law.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> May be sabotaged or damaged drones from reclamation yard processes, old security defenses, or other unknown sources.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> HIGH. Many synthetics boast high durability and toolsets, to include weaponry and shielding. These systems may be absent or damaged, but should be considered in a threat assessment.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Code Blue threat, utilize ion weaponry to quickly disable and dispatch threat if it impedes station grounds and safety. Lost drones from reclamation yard or security processes are likely to be recovered by other drones in short order, avoidance until then is preferred, but not required.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Changelings</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Largely unknown entities capable of devouring and mimicking individuals.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Unknown motivations, and unknown skillset.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> VERY HIGH. Unknown skillset, unknown motivations. Ability to mimic any individual previously consumed.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Immediate red-level threat. All staff are to pair up and remain on high alert. Do not trust corpses.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Malicious Trespassers</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Hostile actors to the station, such as Syndicate members, E-Shui saboteurs, Nanotrasen Nuclear Squads, or any other well-equipped individuals entering station property to cause mass damage, terrorism, or casualties on station.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Largely focused on corporate espionage, focusing on destruction of station or death of crew. May be well equipped.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> HIGH. Expect lethal weaponry and hardsuits, with subversion devices to prevent camera tracking, with door hacking capability. Likely unable to reliably defuse station traps, utilize frequently.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Code Red Situation. All departments MUST lock down, with maintenance doors being bolted and braced against intrusion. Regular patrols must be made to all secure areas, and at least one individual must remain on watch on the main access to the Terraformer's Euthanizer. Strong recommendation of usage for any tactical vehicles for grounds patrols after maintenance access is sealed off, as allowed by crew staffing. Patrols of maintenance after sealing are to be performed by minimum 2 man teams, and any individual performing any patrol must have body cameras equipped, fully activated, and configured to their name.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>Chu-Ukara Parasites</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Infectious parasites of unknown origin, capable of devouring and infecting individuals into their species to spread.
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Most often found in the caverns and deeper areas of maintenance.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> HIGH. Capability to utilize station ductwork for rapid movement and growth, certain specimens, especially those of high-reasoning species post infection, display high levels of tactical capability.
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Code Red situation. Vents and Scrubbers should be welded closed in critical areas with non-essential crew evacuating to the bunker or off-station. Maintenance should be bolted, bracing is not required. Recommended usage of station flamethrowers, directional mines, and bluespace artillery for large infestations.
			<hr/>
			<center><b>All Other Entities</center></b>
			<br/>  <b>Definition:</b> Any other threats not previously identified
			<br/>  <b>Notes:</b> Utilize caution. Recall defense of the Terraformer is highest priority above station survival, but Terraformer defense cannot occur without station. Continual watch of Euthanizer access is necessary for any threat capable of or willing to cause damage to the Terraformer.
			<br/>  <b>Threat:</b> VARIABLE
			<br/>  <b>Recommended Action:</b> Utilize best judgment for weapon usage, condition code, and actions taken. Under no circumstance is the Terraformers Euthanizer to be breached or activated. Avoid excessive damage to the station, and avoid unnecessary crew loss."}

	body = 	{"<center><large><b>E-Shui Building Code.</center></large></b>
			<br>E-Shui adheres to SolGov construction standards, with modifications to ensure crewmember safety and understanding of procedures and construction.
			<br>A 'room' is defined as any enclosed space with three or more walls, and ceiling with at least one entry point, designed for prolonged usage for a specific purpose, defined or undefined.
			<br>A 'hallway' is defined as a long connecting tunnel, either enclosed or open, connecting multiple rooms and areas together.
			<br>An 'area' is defined as either a room or hallway, designed as one functional location, even when the room or hallway is subdivided into multiple smaller sections.
			<br><hr><hr>
			<br>General Guidelines:
			<br>Every room is required to have:
			<br>- One fire extinguisher, tested semi-annually.
			<br>- One fire alarm, mounted on a wall 3ft-4ft off the ground, tested annually.
			<br>- One air vent and air scrubber pair per 600 square feet of floor space to maintain optimal air circulation and refilling.
			<br>- One air alarm, mounted on a wall 4ft from the ground, tested monthly with temperatures to range between 15C and 32C except in freezers, which must be within -10C and 0C.
			<br>- One lightswitch per entry point, located as close to the entry point as possible. Light switches must be equipped with a low-draw LED light to aid in discovery and usage.
			<br>- One intercom, mounted on a wall 3-5ft off the ground. Multiple intercoms in a room must be stacked vertically on the same section of wall space, unless the count would exceed 3 intercoms, in which following intercoms must be place directly horizontally, repeating in sets of 3.

			<br>- One disposal outlet, unless placed in a sensitive operations room where the presence of a disposal outlet would cause injury or damage to station crew and property
			<br>- Emergency shutters over every window and doorway to ensure proper sealing of the room in event of a gas leak or environmental failure. Shutters must be connected to the rooms air alarm via wired or wireless connections, and tested monthly.
			<br>- Catwalk access panels are to be installed at every major junction of piping, wiring, and air pipes no closer than 5 meters apart. Catwalk access panels are not to be tiled over. Only department-relevant repainting of the frame is authorized.
			<br><hr>
			<br>Every hallway in addition must include:
			<br>- One geiger counter, mounted 4ft-6ft off the ground.
			<br>- One AI display, mounted at 4ft-5ft off the ground.
			<br>- One Station Status Display, mounted at 4ft5ft off the ground.
			<br>- Station and AI displays must be mounted in parallel; either directly across, or directly adjacent to one another for ease of discovery, when both are to be mounted in an area.
			<br>- Hallways may not have a lightswitch, and must be always lit during station hours.
			<br><hr>
			<br>Every head of staff office must also include:
			<br>- One Command and Communications console
			<br>- One Keycard Authenticator
			<br>- Any and all lockdown switches for the department, located in the same area and appropriately labeled
			<br>- One set of paperwork machinery. (Fax machine, paper shredder, employment records, photocopier, paper bin, and department head stamp)
			<br>- One fireaxe cabinet for emergency usage
			<br>- One Requests Console specialized for the appropriate department
			<br><hr>
			<br>No wall-mounted machinery is to be mounted in an inaccessible location. They cannot be mounted more than 6 feet high, or less than 2 feet low. In the case of Heavier Than Air Gas (HTAG) sensors, they must be mounted 4-6 inches from the floor, directly below the rooms air alarm and connected by hard wire. No wireless methods may connect air sensors to their controller.
			<br>Wall mounted machinery is not to be blocked by furniture that would impede or unreasonably delay access during an emergency.
			<br>Fire extinguisher count is a minimum and not maximum. Areas with more flammability hazard, or spaces larger than 500sqft should consider having multiple cabinets for ease of usage in an emergency.
			<br>Light switches are not to be installed in public hallways, or critical department hallways, as these areas must remain continually lit.
			<br>Every room excluding hallways must be designated as smoking or nonsmoking, and must be signed appropriately on the interior or exterior of the room.
			<br>Any room that is subdivided into multiple sections capable of being airtight, such as rooms that have inner doors, glass walls, or any other method of dividing a room, all individual sections of the room are required to have a unique pair of air alarms, and vent and scrubber pair, to ensure safety and proper airflow.
			<br><hr>
			<center><b>Optional wall installations:</center></b>
			<br>Newscasters, AI displays, Station Status Displays, Nanomed stations, Station maps, and Geiger counters are optional wall mounted devices able to be installed. These devices must be installed at a usable height on clear wall space as space allows. At least one of every device is required to be installed in every department, and at least one in every break room.
			<br>Wall mounted power cell chargers must be installed 3ft-4ft off the ground, with up to 3 per wall section. Desk-based chargers must be securely attached to the table, with up to two chargers per table. Internal breakers must be tested monthly.
			<br><hr>
			<center><b>Construction:</center></b>
			<br>Station walls are to be made out of steel, divided into even sections, approximately 1m in size. All interior walls are to be built to standard. All station exterior walls are to be reinforced. In addition, all exterior walls of a department, separating a department from a civilian access area must also be reinforced. All exterior walls, roof tiles, railings, and staircases must also be coated in E-Shui rigidized protegenous polymer
			<br>
			<br>Windows are to follow standard based on need and area: Any windows on a ground floor, or basement level, where wildlife or hostile actors could walk along ground to access it; defined as 'exterior windows', must be constructed with a dual pane, with a grill placed in-between. Window grills leading into a department, or secure area must be electrified. Windows dividing a department from a civilian area, or dividing a secure area must be counted as an exterior window and reinforced as such.
			<br>Inner-station windows, such as dividing a hallway and room, when not separating a department from a civilian area, must be only a single 'full tile' window, with a grill installed underneath it. Interior station windows that are not separating departments or secure areas are not to be electrified.
			<br>Exterior windows on a roof level, where they access open space or an exposed roof lacking an exterior ladder or stairwell are to be constructed using a minor hybrid system, where the primary window is a full panel, with an additional pane installed on the exterior. Ones leading into departments or secure areas must be electrified.
			<br>
			<br> Airlocks are always to be designed as a ground level exterior barrier, with reinforced walls on every connecting wall of the airlock, and double-paned windows on both sides of the airlock. An access button must be provided on both interior and exterior, mounted at 3ft-4ft off the ground, with an airlock controller mounted inside the airlock at 4ft off the ground. Airlocks must be supplied with umbrellas and flashlights for external access, and an emergency closet inside, or immediately outside of the airlock within the station.
			<br>
			<br>Wiring must be color coded to voltage specifications. Each inner-department must be green in color, with sub-department wires heading in descending order from cyan, yellow, red, gray, white, then color of choice except for orange, green, or prior used colors. All wires along the station spine and maintenance must be heavy duty cabling. Each departments inner wires must be separated by a breaker box, bypassing the department Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) device. Each SMES must be located indoors, in maintenance, with access for both engineering and the relevant department.
			<br>Station power that is not along the station spine, but connects to the mains power connecting off the engine output SMES, or directly to engine output in the event of the engine bypass being enabled, the must be orange in color to denote the higher voltage. High density cables along the spine are not to connect directly to a department SMES.
			<br>Wiring is to avoid crossing under walls or dense structures, when wiring must pass under walls, an access panel must be installed in the wall to allow access to the wire, and to signal engineers of the wires passage. When crossing secure windows must not pass through, and instead must be dotted through to ensure proper electrification of the window. Wiring in unsecure areas is allowed to pass straight through a window grille, or under a doorway.
			<br>APCs and wiring connections are not to be installed above large, immobile machinery that impedes or disrupts access to the APC or wire reconnection in the event of necessary reconstruction or sabotage. Wiring that connects to lightning rods, solar panels, or other alternate forms of power generation must connect to the stations main line and not departmental power, except in the case of critical areas such as Telecoms or the AI core.
			<br>Station wiring is not to cross in matching directions with a different coded wire. Wire crosses and splits exceeding 5 meters must have an access panel installed above the junction. Wire junctions under catwalk access do not need an access panel.
			<br>
			<br>Station bathrooms are designated as a private area, and are not to have any; cameras, microphones, chips, sensors, or any other method of recording or monitoring crew in the bathrooms. Each individual stall is to have at least one scrubber vent to allow proper ventilation of gasses, and must have a drainage port located by the main door, and at the lowest point of the room, to allow for safe drainage. Bathrooms must include at least one sink, mirror, and toilet. With urinals, and cyborg charger as allowed by space. All bathroom devices; sinks, toilets, showers, runoff drains, and any other liquid disposal drainage must link to the station septic tank for safe filtration and disposal. Each bathroom must be uniquely named per department for safe and rapid location for medical or engineering incidents, names must not use profanity, vulgar or racial slurs, deceptive implications, or duplicated names in any of the primary languages recognized by E-Shui official. (Galactic common, Schechi, Tradeband, Vox Pidgin, Canilunzt, Sagaru, or SolGov Braille)
			<br>
			<br>Station showers must have appropriate drainage, with drains in each shower stall, at the entrance, and at the lowest point of the room. Each stall must be constructed with tinted or frosted glass, a shower head built to SolGov standard of metal or PVC piping. Shower head water must be connected to the freshwater tank located on site, and tested regularly for enzymatic contamination. (See: E-Shui inspection guidelines)
			<br>Showers must be equipped with at least one table of plastic or glass per 5 showers for towel and clothing storage. The Air Alarm in the room must be adjusted for humidity removal.
			<br>
			<br>Railings must be installed along every open edge, to the sides and back of every stairwell, and anywhere that presents a hazard to crew safety should movement be unimpeded. Railings must be secured at both ends and every 3 feet, with a horizontal rung located at 2ft, and 4.5ft off the ground. Railings must be coated with an enzyme neutralizer.
			<br>Staircases must be constructed with a textured surface of; ridged, ribbed, slatted, or bumped surfacing, and given a non-slip painting. Stairs must descend at a 7-11 run. Ramps for garage access must not exceed an 8% grade, and must also be treated with a nonslip paint. Every staircase landing must have a drainage vent linked to the station gray water disposal.
			<br>
			<br>Disposal pipes are not to cross under walls, and must be constructed of 3ft diameter steel. The stations disposal network is to make one continuous loop from and to cargo. A package sorting diversion junction must be located directly after the cargo outlet for appropriate sorting prior to waste transitioning to the incinerator, and an E-Shui proprietary Autosleeving Body Diversion Junction located prior to the cargo waste and mail sorting area. Direct to incinerator lines are not to link with the primary disposal loop until after the package sorting diversion junction, when directly destined for the incinerator.
			<br>All disposal outlets direct to incinerator must be color coded red, with appropriate signage located directly above the bin. Disposal pipes in maintenance that cross or link with another pipe that are destined for the incinerator must be signed appropriately.
			<br>All department disposal mail sorting junctions must be linked to only one disposal outlet, and the corresponding disposal outlet must be color coded blue and labeled with the appropriate destination label.
			<br>Any department mailing rooms must be supplied with at least 2 meters of exposed conveyor belt with a connecting controller, flaps for crew safety, and a table for storing packaging material on. The table and belts must not impede crew mobility.
			<br>
			<br>Wooden floors installed on station must be constructed of treated wood, painted with a clear rigidized protegenous polymer. Boards must be within 2-5 inches wide, and 4-12 feet long, unless space necessitates trimming. Boards must have empty space filled with water and enzyme proof adhesives to maintain structure and minimize risk of separation. Carpets must be installed with a slip-proof cover along the edges to minimize wear and tear, and lessen tripping hazards.
			<br>
			<br>Every department must have at least one break room accessible at any time by that department's crew members. Each break room must have a wooden or carpeted floor, at least one sofa, microwave and/or vending machine for food and drink. In addition, they must contain a cyborg charger either in the break room, or in easy and immediate access just outside of the break room.

			<br><hr>
			<center><b>Medstations:</center></b>
			Medical emergency treatment rooms located throughout the station must be equipped with at minimum: 2 lights, one body scanner, one backup kiosk, and appropriate table space for medicine storage and stocked with multiple roller beds for safe transport. Each medical treatment area must be appropriately signed and may not be configured for night lighting, and lights must be on at all times during station hours.
			All med stations must be publicly accessible, even when located inside of departments. All medical stations must be floor marked and signed as a medical area for ease of location.
			<br><hr>
			<center><b>Marking:</center></b>
			<br>Every department must be signed to denote importance and accessibility. Sub-departments must also be appropriately signed. Department signs must be color coded appropriately and mounted 3-5' off the ground from the bottom of the sign.
			<br>In public hallways, directional signs must be mounted in sequence with the center located 4' off the ground, and must be mounted at every major intersection and tram station.
			<br>Areas of hazardous nature must be clearly and appropriately marked for crew safety prior to entrance into any area that might prove hazardous. Warning signs may be adjusted on height based on crew expected usage at eye level or close to the hazard itself in the case of small or specific hazard areas.
			<br>Machinery must be clearly marked for the hazard it poses to crew along the machine itself.
			<br>Any area accessed vertically must be marked with a faint gray outline to allow for appropriate and safe ladder placement.

			<br>Any crew member is authorized to recommend to a head of staff, captain, or central command; another crew member who may be deserving of a medal for a specific act or action. The below medals are organized in a rough order of significance.
			<hr>
			<br><b><large>Ceremonial awards:</large></b> These awards hold minor significance, being more signs of one's competency and career with E-Shui, than any heroic or specialty actions.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br><b>Survey Corps Patch:</b> A somewhat rare laminated shoulder patch, depicting a spyglass amongst stars. Awarded by E-Shui CC to those who found stations and planets, or discover new ones. Normally seen on 'early adopters' of E-Shui stations, and seen as a sign of experience more than anything. Only awarded by central command.
			<br>
			<br><b>Pilot's Pin:</b> A small brass pin awarded to crew members that are capable of flying at least a class I shuttle without supervision, depicting a pair of wings and parachute, indicative of an old riggers award. Note: EVA training is recommended, but not required to be had in order to be capable of flying a class I shuttle. This medal can be awarded by any head of staff.
			<br>
			<br><b>Officer's Qualification pin:</b> A small golden pin, denoting the individual is capable of holding a leadership position on station. Worn by any head of staff, even if they are not currently working as a head of staff on shift. This medal can be awarded by a captain, head of personnel, or central command.
			<br>
			<br><b>E-Shui Captaincy Medal:</b> A golden medal awarded exclusively to those promoted to the rank of captain. It is only awarded by central command, and denotes the trust central command has shown in the crew member to handle any crisis the station may encounter. An individual promoted to captain may not wear their officer qualification pin, as E-Shui classifies them as the same award. An individual certified as an E-Shui captain not currently working as a captain is still authorized to wear their captain pin, or their officer pin.
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br><b><large>Service awards:</large></b> These medals are low level badges of honor and service to the crew, and can be awarded by any head of staff. They exclusively come from acts above and beyond one's obligations and calls to action, and recognize their individual achievement. Heads of staff should only award the most notable or significant award for an action.
			<br>
			<br><b>Meritorious Defense Medal:</b> A bronze medallion awarded to crew members for meritorious achievement or service to the station, with a red and gold ribbon. It's commonly awarded to crew that go above and beyond their necessary duties to aid the station during a crisis, or even in standard operations.
			<br>
			<br><b>Bronze Heart Medal:</b> A bronze heart with a purple ribbon, awarded to crew who suffer permanent injury or death in service to the station. While advances in resleeving and medical make it nearly impossible to obtain, E-Shui still recognizes and awards the medal to those meeting qualification. (Note: Refusing treatment until after the award is given is considered defrauding E-Shui.)
			<br>
			<br><b>Defensive Operations Medal:</b> An iron star awarded to crew members for exemplary service in defense of the station and crew, with an iron exterior, golden rings, and a central blue star. While not exclusive to security, it is only awarded for actions taken in defense of the station and crew that drastically aid in the operations of the station and crew during a crisis.
			<br>
			<br><b>Combat Action Medal:</b> A silver medal awarded to crew members for honorable service while under enemy fire, depicting a sword, with a purple, gold, and silver ribbon. Unlike the defensive operations medal, this medal is awarded specifically for engaging with a hostile enemy force beyond that of standard station wildlife. This award is not exclusive to security forces, even though they're the most likely to achieve and wear it.
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br><b><large>Exemplary service awards:</large></b> These medals are a high level of honor, and can only be awarded by the captain, or central command. Although any head of staff can recommend the award. These medals show one's dedication to their station, their bravery, and their competency.
			<br>
			<br><b>Medal of Valor:</b> A silver medal awarded to crew members for acts of exceptional valor and heroism, above and beyond any expectation. Depicting an eagle, with a gold, red, and purple ribbon.
			<br>
			<br><b>Medical Action Award:</b> A white heart emblazoned with a red cross awarded to crew for service as a medic in a combat zone. This medal is exclusive to medical staff operating during a combat crisis, making it exceptionally rare.
			<br>
			<br><b>SolGov Sapientarian Medal:</b> A golden medal awarded to crew for significant contributions to sapient rights.
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br><b><large>Exceptional service awards:</large></b> These medals are the highest achievement one can obtain, and as such are only awarded by central command. These medals can only be recommended by a head of personnel or captain.
			<br>
			<br><b>E-Shui Service Medal:</b> A golden medal awarded to crew members for significant contributions to the station and its crew, depicting an ornate symbol with a green and gold ribbon. This medal is not tied to necessitating any crisis or hazard.
			<br>
			<br><b>E-Shui Medal of Honor:</b> A golden medal awarded to crew members for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty during a crisis. Depicting an ornate medal, wings on the side, and a blue star in the middle, with a purple, blue, and gold ribbon.
			<br>
			<br><b>E-Shui Medal of Heroism:</b> A golden star awarded to crew members for acts of incredible heroism during a combat situation, depicting a long star 'tear drop', with a red crest, and a green, gold, and silver ribbon. It is not exclusive to security, however must be earned during an active role during a combat situation, beyond that of normal station wildlife.
			<br>
			<br><b>E-Shui Medal of Exceptional Heroism:</b> A golden medal awarded for only the most distinguished actions, depicting the portrait of an individual, with a red, gold, and blue ribbon. It is the highest honor that any individual can achieve, and as such, is the rarest award found on any E-Shui station."}

	Author = "Diana Kuznetsova"
	body = {"<center><b>E-Shui Xenoarcheological Studies and Research Field Guide</b>
			<br><b><u>Xenoarcheology, Anomalies, and You</u></b> </center>
			<br>
			<br><b>A letter to any aspiring xenoarcheologist</b>:
			<br>Xenoarcheology is an inherently dangerous, ever-changing field with numerous lost relics and artifacts that can be found.
			<br>While some relics may be beneficial and others mundane, some can be <b>highly</b> lethal for both organics and synthetics alike!
			<br>
			<br>Due to the ever-changing nature of this field and frequent word-of-mouth education, we have written this guide in order to protect you, the station, and most importantly: Our Terraformer.
			<br><hr><center><b>Equipment</b></center>
			<br><b>Mandatory Equipment:</b>
			<br>Eyewear - Meson Scanners
			<br><small> Allows for visualization of artifacts, which often appear as large brown deposits with white streaks through them. </small>
			<br>Hand Equipment - Pickaxe
			<br><small> Allows for reaching artifact deposit sites.</small>
			<br>
			<br><b>Specialty / Critical Equipment:</b>
			<br>
			<br>Alden-Saraspova Counter (ASC)
			<br><small> Allows for pinpointing the site of artifacts.
			<br>Upon use, it will output a string that appears like such:
			<br>Large artifact energy signature detected on wavelength '%IDENTIFIER' in a radius of %DISTANCE; small anomaly detected in a radius of %DISTANCE
			<br>Pinpointing an artifact can be performed by scanning, seeing what the distance reads, then moving to the North, South, East, or West for a few meters and re-scanning.
			<br>This distance has a detection variation of +/- 2m
			<br>
			<br>USAGE:
			<br>If the number goes up (further away), go in the opposite direction.
			<br>If the number stays the same, it means that the artifact has a greater pull in another direction (If staying the same when going East/West, the artifact has a greater pull towards the North/South, for example.
			<br>
			<br>Depth Analysis Scanner (DAS)
			<br><small> Allows for scanning artifact deposits to learn the artifact type and depth.
			<br>
			<br>USAGE:
			<br>To use, simply scan a deposit with the scanner and then look at the display, where it will output four lines of information:
			<br>Time: What time the scan was taken
			<br>Coords<sic>: Where the anomaly deposit was at when scanned.
			<br>Anomaly Depth: How far down the anomaly is.
			<br>Anomaly Material: What type of energy signature the anomaly is off-putting.
			<br>
			<br>NOTES:
			<br>While Material is useful, Depth is the most essential part.
			<br>If there are multiple artifacts in one deposit, every artifact onward is already excavated as far as you have dug.
			<br>(I.e, artifact 1: 50, artifact 2: 100. You have dug to 50. You only need to dig 50mm more to unearth artifact 2)
			<br>If there is a large artifact in the deposit, upon excavating all small artifacts, the depth scanner will read 'ERROR' for depth. This means that after excavating the deposit to >200 mm, rocky debris will be left behind, which must be further excavated with a hand pick or a excavation pick.
			<br>(This large artifact is sealed from the outside world until excavated, in which it may activate.)</small>
			<br>
			<br>Excavation Pick Set & Hand Pickaxe
			<br><small> Allows for carefully excavating artifacts.
			<br>Digging too deep or not using picks will result in their potential destruction or improper excavation.
			<br>
			<br>USAGE:
			<br>Look at the Anomaly Depth given to you by the Depth Analysis Scanner
			<br>Select the appropriate picks to dig to <b>EXACTLY</b> that depth.
			<br>For reference:
			<br>Brush 1, Red 2, orange 4, yellow 6, olive 8, blue 10, purple 12. (For color blind individuals look at the length/notches on the shaft of the excavation picks)
			<br>Hand Pickaxe: 30 mm</small>
			<br>
			<br><b>Supplementary Equipment:</b>
			<br>Xenoarcheology Multitool
			<br><small>Works as the Alden-Saraspova counter, Depth Analysis Scanner, and Measuring Tape all in one tool.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Excavation Drill
			<br><small>Replaces the Excavation Pick Set & Hand Pickaxe. Can dig from 1 to 60 mm in one go.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Measuring Tape
			<br><small>Allows seeing how far your current excavation is.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Core Sampler
			<br><small>Useless. Do not bother with it.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Locator Device + Tracking Beacon
			<br><small>Tracking beacon can be set to a frequency, placed on a table, and the Locator can then be set to the same frequency. Tell the locator to 'search' for the device and place it down some ways away from the tracking beacon and they will pair, allowing the tracking beacon to be located at all times.
			<br>NOTES:
			<br>Do not place the tracking beacon and locator too close while searching, otherwise they will be incapable of linking.
			<br>The tracking beacon allows individuals to teleport to the beacon via the station's many teleporters.</small>
			<br>
			<br>GPS
			<br><small>Make sure to activate it and give it a unique identifier, such as your name.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Excavation Suit + Excavation Hood
			<br><small>A pressure sealed suit for excavating in locations that lack or have a hostile atmosphere. Lined with asbestos and lead, rendering it radiation immune.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Anomaly Hood + Anomaly Suit + Latex Gloves + goggles
			<br><small>Allows for examining and interacting with anomalies, lowering the chance of negative effects.
			<br>NOTE: Does not block EMPs emitted from artifacts.
			<br>: A properly fitted gasmask and internals are suggested for crew that need to breathe.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Suspension Field Generator
			<br><small>Can be pulled along and wrenched down. Upon turning on, will place whatever entity is directly in front of it in stasis. Recommended for extremely skilled archeologists only.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Sample Container
			<br>small>Allows storing small artifacts found in an orderly fashion.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Anomaly Container
			<br><small>Allows safe storage and transport of an anomaly. These are large cases held in a secondary storage room.
			<br>This lead lined container will hold an artifact inside, indefinitely preventing its effects.</small>
			<br>
			<br><hr><center><b>Machinery</b></center>
			<br>Anomaly Analyzer
			<br><small>When next to an Anomaly Scanner Pad, can be used to analyze an anomaly on the Scanner Pad. This will give triggering factors and information as to the effects of the anomaly. More detail will be listed in the 'Artifact Identification' and 'Artifact Activation' sections of this document.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Exotic Particle Harvester
			<br><small>When next to an Anomaly Scanner Pad with an anomaly on the Scanner Pad, can be used to extract the energy of an artifact into a Anomaly power battery.</small>
			<br><hr><center><b>Artifact Identification</b>
			<br></center>
			<br> can be identified in a plethora of ways, ranging from the coloration and 'look' of their effect to the artifact shape and form itself.
			<br>Artifacts that have the same effect have been noted to have the same energy appearance, such as sparkles, or a blue sphere around it for example. Memorizing the artifact
			<br>
			<br>Some smaller artifacts may be seemingly meaningless trinkets and baubles such as coins, but may also contain energetic effects, such as off-putting EMP waves, allowing resurrection of dead subjects, or creation of entirely new entities.
			<br>
			<br>Additionally, artifacts can vary even with the same effect. Some will only cause an effect it touched, nearby, or on a multi kilometer basis.
			<br>Needless to say, if an artifact has the ability to effect the entire outpost with hostile effects, it should be quickly placed into an Anomaly Container for storage and safety.
			<br>
			<br>NOTE: Artifacts can multiple anomalous effects at once.
			<br><hr><center><b>Artifact Activation</b></center>
			<br>After scanning the artifact in the Anomaly Analyzer, it will note down some potential activators for the artifact. For quick reference, the potential activators will be noted here as well.
			<br>
			<br>Physical Interaction: Simply touch the artifact with ungloved hands.
			<br>
			<br>Chemical Interaction: Involves splashing a specific reagent onto the artifact via a beaker. Involves four subsections:
			<br><small>Water: Hydrogen or Water
			<br>Acid: Sulfuric Acid or Diethylamine
			<br>Volatile: Thermite, Hydrophoron, Phoron
			<br>Toxic: Any toxins, such as liquid lead.</small>
			<br>
			<br>Forceful or Energetic Interaction:
			<br>If it is energetic, a multitool, stun baton, energy blade, or an energy beam can activate it.
			<br>If it is forceful, a strong blow with something such as a full sized fire extinguisher or other strong object can activate it.
			<br>
			<br>Precise Temperature Conditions:
			<br>If it is triggered by heat, a lit welder can activate it. Alternatively, an atmosphere above 375K can activate it.
			<br>If it is triggered by cold, the surrounding air must be cooled below 225K for the artifact to activate.
			<br><hr><center><b>Artifact Harvesting</b></center>
			<br>In order to harvest an artifact, the artifact must be placed on the Anomaly Scanner Pad next to an Exotic Particle Harvester.
			<br>Afterwards, an Anomaly power battery must be placed inside the Exotic Particle Harvester. Upon telling the harvester to activate, it will scan the artifact and note down any energy signals it detects and give the best approximation of what effect the energy signal creates.
			<br>Selecting this signal will then harvest the energy into the battery.
			<br>This battery can, once full, be removed from the artifact and placed in an Anomaly power utilizer. From here, the duration between energy pulses and the duration the utilizer will work for. This can be used only a limited amount of times before having to be recharged. Research can yield greater battery sizes.
			<br>
			<br><hr><center><b>Quick Reference / How to Excavate</b>
			<br>
			<br>Step 0: Obtain a mind and body backup. Retrieve a 'Death Alarm Implant' from Medical. If extreme safety is desired, perform step 6.5 now.
			<br>
			<br>Step 1: Grab a belt, mesons, and pickaxe.
			<br>
			<br>Step 2: Put the following in your belt: GPS (After activating it), Alden-Saraspova Counter (ASC), Depth Analysis Scanner (DAS), Excavation Pick Set & Hand Pickaxe.
			<br>
			<br>Step 3: Go outside to an appropriate location and scan with your ASC. Go in various directions until the number on the ASC is becoming smaller and you see a brown deposit  with white streaks in it. Go over towards it.
			<br>Step 4: Use your DAS on the deposit and examine the depth. Proceed to use your Excavation Pick Set to perfectly excavate the artifact to that exact depth.
			<br>
			<br>Step 5: An artifact (small) will be excavated. Continue to excavate until the DAS reads no more signatures, or until it reads 'ERROR' in which case dig >200mm and then dig the rocky debris up.
			<br>
			<br>Step 6: Bring your finds back to the Anomaly lab.
			<br>
			<br>Step 6.5: Put on an Anomaly Suit, Anomaly Hood, Latex Gloves, Gas Mask w/ Oxygen Tank attached, and goggles. (If not already done in Step 0)
			<br>
			<br>Step 7: Place the artifact in the Artifact Analyzer and scan it. Reference the 'Artifact Activation' on how to activate it given what the paper reads.
			<br>
			<br>Step 7.5: Harvest it with the harvester, if desired.
			<br>
			<br>Step 8: Place the artifact in a safe location while deactivated, or in an Anomaly Container if deactivation is unable to be performed.
