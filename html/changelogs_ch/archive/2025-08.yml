  - balance: The doorway bosses to base Neon have a bit less HP.
  - bugfix: Tyr ants stop infighting

  - balance: Completely rewrote R&D to be made up of "techweb nodes" that you research
      with experiments + passive point generation. This turns it from a question of
      how to max all levels as fast as possible, to figuring out what paths you want
      to go down and unlock with a time gate.
