	"body": "<p>Recently, local Outpost-21 had undergone extensive sublevel repair work. Blue Space Artillery (BSA) Ordinance was utilized to force caves and illegal tunnels to collapse, and while the structures were leveled with controlled demolition, drone teams had dug down into the ground to better reinforce the structures against continual sinkhole collapses utilizing large concrete pillars.</p><br><p>These concrete pillars will likely not effect crew operations, and are meant only to brace against any ground shifting in the event of cave collapse. In addition, the Bunker was rebuilt in a lower cave system and reinforced, allowing for better capability in threat suppression on station and more security for those seeking refuge within.</p><br><p>And while Central Command still has the lower caverns, or 'Underdark' as restricted access and discourages crew, they acknowledge incidents of crewmembers accidentally falling down cave openings, or being dragged down there by malicious actors, and as such, ERT construction teams have set up small shelters in the 'underdark' caverns for emergency usage for trapped crew awaiting rescue. But reiterates, this is not an excuse or reason to delve below.</p><br><p>Rebuilding of primary structures completed during Thursday's B-Shift, in time for C-Shift to 'put it through its paces.' And ensure crew that normal station operations should not be disrupted from normal, but wished to request Engineering teams to verify build code was adhere to during the rebuilding process.</p>",

The station suffered minor damage during the ordeal, with Asset Reclamation being dispatched, though no trace of the skrell could be found on station.</p><br><p>The crew were recovered safe and sound in the bunker, with an apparent improvised explosive set up in front of the door, with an explosive charge and damage to the tanks suggesting a failed detonation. Though, ordinance disposal teams suggested that had it gone off, it would have had enough power to blow through the bunker door.</p><br><p>No crew were reported as casualties, and were returned to central safely.</p><br><p>In other news, remodeling to the Medical department was approved, and uploaded to station blueprints. Drone teams will be working around the clock to take advantage of the recent station damage to remodel the Medical department, to improve performance and efficiency, based off review from crew usage during the shifts.</p><br><p>Central requests that all medical staff provide feedback on the new layout, to continue improvements to station comfort and efficiency.</p><br><p>Finally, Central Command has issued a directive on the 'haunted corpses', following a few crewmembers disappearing to the rumored 'Redspace' and reappearing as one. And are recommending investigation, and careful action around these anomalies, suggesting to study them, instead of immediately destroying them. As destroying one that was a crewmember capable of revival, will be seen as medical malpractice.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Local Outpost-21 was recently the attack of Skrell actors, one suspected of having ties with Skrelgov. The individual was detected quickly by the station AI, and encountered quickly by the on-duty Medical Director, and a Paramedic, when gunfire was exchanged, seriously injuring the MD, before they were able to down the assailant, who then activated an explosive implant. Killing both medics and causing minor damage to the station spine.</p><br><p>Energy signatures were later detected, and identified as a Skrell-made ship passing through at high velocity, releasing a single, small payload, originally missed during meteor and perimeter sweeps. Conflicting with the operative's 'syndicate' identification.</p><br><p>Both medics were able to be revived, however the assailant's brain and body were destroyed completely in the blast. Later, an insider threat was discovered with unknown objectives, also detonating in security after on-site staff attempted to remove the positronic core, resulting in the death of the RD, an officer, and severe damage to the security forensics ward.</p><br><p>After both were subdued, central command was placed on lockdown for insider threats and were forced to neutralize and restrain all staff on return to central command, however, no evidence of further threats was noted. Security Commander Penance was then requested on the following shift to provide training on appropriate responses to threats to the station.</p><br><p>C-Shift's Medical Director couldn't be reached for comment on why medics, and not on-staff security, responded to the initial threat, and subsequently lost their lives.</p>",

Engineers assure crew that targeting errors causing the beam to slice through the station have been corrected.</p><br><p>The temporary orbital station will be scrapped, and E-Shui officials would like to give thanks to the hard working shipbreakers for finding a sufficient vessel to house the new station, the former SGSV 'Lightshiner', found derelict after a meteor pierced the hull and detonated fuel lines, starting a fire that ultimately doomed the ship. Construction crews led by Chief Engineers Taaa and Aiektaaknell have been hard at work tearing down, rebuilding, and redesigning the vessel to house the new, permanent PTL platform.</p><br><p>In addition, due to structural reworks of the surface facility's security departments, and security concerns of its location, the AI core will also be located in geosynchronous orbit above Muriki, nearby to the new PTL station. Security personnel hope this change will allow for better enhanced security after a plot for AI hijack was foiled by A-Shift security forces.</p><br><p>In other news, Spring has come to Outpost-21 once more, and we would like to remind crew to be aware of the change of weather, and take adequate protections when venturing on EVA operations.</p>",

	"body": "<p>Local Outpost-21 is set to receive a test version of a new source of transferring energy. Utilized on other stations on a smaller scale, the new setup will be a Power-Transfer Laser (PTL) design. This will allow much larger and more efficient engines to be utilized, even ones currently not authorized on planetary usage such as the supermatter or singularity engines. The laser will be set up on a close-range geosync station, where the engines will produce power, and will be transferred into the PTL to be fired down on the planet to ensure power output is reliable.</p><br><p>Currently, a test-design of the platform is accessible to station engineers via a shuttle parked nearby. Upon final approval of the engine, the orbital station will be reworked, finalized, and have access for the Mining Trawler, Medical, and Security shuttles, in addition to the engineering short-range shuttle.</p><br><p>While the collector array is not yet finalized in location, engineers can order one from Cargo, however, E-Shui command would like to remind engineers to take special caution when aligning the collector and emitter array on the orbital station, to avoid any accidental incineration of station property and crew.</p>",
